# Readme
 
 The LCD  was implemented using a microcontroller that was sent distances in UART at a Baud rate of 9600. 
 To simplify and speed up the design process, the microcontroller was programmed in Energia.
 Characters were sent in ASIC to easily program the LCD. 
 The microcontroller was configured to wait for character to be sent over UART.  
 The distances sent were represented in ASIC.
